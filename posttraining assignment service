Make sure you’re connecting via the public IP, from outside the cluster.
Check the POD status, it should be running with all containers in service.
To confirm that a pod is part of the service, examine the corresponding Endpoints object with kubectl get endpoints.
Check whether you’re connecting to the nodeport exposed by the service and not the target port.
Try connecting to the pod IP directly to confirm your pod is accepting connections on the correct port.
